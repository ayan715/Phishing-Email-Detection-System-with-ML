üìß Phishing Email Detection System with ML

A web-based application that analyzes email files and raw content to detect potential phishing attempts using Machine Learning (Random Forest) and rule-based heuristics.

This system allows users to upload .eml files or paste raw email text/HTML into a simple web interface. It then applies a trained Random Forest model (with a TF-IDF vectorizer) along with additional security checks to classify and explain whether the email is legitimate or phishing.
